    <h1>Conclusion</h1>
    <p>Although the aesthetic of products and websites attracts people to 
        them I believe it is what the functionality and information the 
        products have that is important. It was easy to see on the Beauty 
        and Usefulness pages. Even though the Beauty page looks nice and its 
        layout makes it easier to read the user missed out on the fun of 
        the buttons. The Usefulness page had all the same information needed 
        for its page without the layout and added looks, with an addition of some added fun.
        Same goes for any product, the main purpose is to get the work done. 
        Some of the reasons why function is more important than aesthetics:</p>
    <ul>
        <li>Users get frustrated fast and leave the site or ditch the product</li>
        <li>Something can look good but if it does not do what is intended to do what's the point?</li>
        <li>It gets the work done or to get the information needed the product needs to work in the ways it is supposed to</li>
        <li>Keeps the users interested and coming back</li>
    </ul>
